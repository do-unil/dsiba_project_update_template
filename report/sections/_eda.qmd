# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Initial Visualizations
Present initial visualizations to help understand data distributions and relationships between variables.

```{r}
#| label: initial-visualizations
#| eval: false # do not evaluate as this is just an example

# Example code block for EDA visualization: Histogram of a numeric variable (once again, we already loaded `ggplot2` in the setup chunk)
ggplot(data_clean, aes(x = numeric_variable)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Numeric Variable")
```

## Summary Statistics
Provide summary statistics for key variables to give an overview of the data.

```{r}
#| label: summary-statistics
#| eval: false # do not evaluate as this is just an example

# Summary statistics example
summary(data_clean)
```

## Key Findings or Patterns
Summarize any preliminary patterns or insights observed in the data so far.
