```{r}
#| label: data-cleaning

# Example of a code block for data cleaning

# load data
# Example loading and cleaning steps
data <- read.csv(here::here("data/raw/data_raw.csv"))

# Example cleaning steps (we already loaded `tidyverse` in the report setup chunk)
data_clean <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(behavior) & !is.na(performance)) %>%  # filter out NAs in both relevant columns
  mutate(
    behavior = as.factor(behavior),    # convert behavior to factor
    TA = as.factor(TA)                 # also convert TA to factor since it's categorical
  )

knitr::kable(data_clean)

# Write the cleaned data to a new file
# e.g. 
# write.csv(data_clean, "data/clean/data_processed.csv", row.names = FALSE)
